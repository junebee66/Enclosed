In 2100, there was a major corruption all access and ownership of the data in the world due to the Data War between The Decentralized and The Central. In order to recover the internet world and settled the society, The Central started the Receptionism Plan. They sent out over ten thousand of hunters groups to the past. The hunters will give non-living objects senses to collect data; therefore in 2100, they will have more data sources in 2100. They called this process as "activating".
Number 34 and his team was sent back to the year of 2020. They traveled through time and space by possess onto the objects they have activated. The mission was long and dangerous.
For the mission to be successful, they can't detach from The Central's activating system.
When the mission was coming to an end they only have 3 percent left to activate in 2020.
However. Number 34 noticed that the objects they activated so far are not fixed data, instead every individual data is constantly changing by the course of time. He tried to report to The Central, but soon found out that they have been trapped in an enclosed dimension. They lost all connections with 2100 world. In this enclosed space, everything loops on an hour bases other than the activated objects. Within this mix data dimension, Number 34 and his team started building their own system to try to get out of this enclosed space..
